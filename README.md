# _printf !

## Welcome to the printf project !
One of the many projects included in my curriculum at Holberton School.
This was the first major project in my journey to become a web and mobile developer.
It was completed in collaboration with another student, as part of a team of two.
The goal was to write our own version of the printf function, while following a set of technical requirements and constraints.
These will be detailed in the next section of this README.
